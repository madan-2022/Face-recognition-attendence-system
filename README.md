# Face-recognition-attendence-system
Description: The Face Recognition Attendance System is a project built using Python and machine learning algorithms, designed to automate the process of attendance management. The system leverages computer vision and facial recognition techniques to identify individuals and record their attendance accurately.

# Key Features:

1.Face Detection:
The system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and locate human faces within images or video streams. It identifies facial landmarks and extracts unique features for further processing.

2.Face Recognition:
Using machine learning algorithms such as the Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, or Deep Learning-based models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the system matches the detected faces against a pre-trained database of known individuals. This allows for accurate recognition and identification of individuals.

3.Attendance Recording:
Once a face is recognized, the system records the attendance of the identified individual. It maintains a log of the date, time, and person's identity for future reference or analysis.


By combining Python programming, machine learning algorithms, and computer vision techniques, the Face Recognition Attendance System automates attendance management processes. It provides a reliable and efficient solution for accurately recognizing individuals, recording attendance, and simplifying administrative tasks.
